# Privacy Policy

## Overview

PawTrack values your privacy. This policy explains what information is collected, how it is used, and your choices. By using the app, you agree to this policy.

## Data We Store Locally

Your pet profiles, health events, reminders, and AI assessment results are stored locally on your device using Apple frameworks. We do not automatically transmit this data to our servers. If you delete the app, locally stored data may be removed by the system.

## Photos and AI Analysis

When you request an AI Body Condition Score (BCS), the photos you choose or capture are sent securely to a third‑party AI provider to generate the assessment. Before sending, the app re‑encodes each selected image into a new JPEG, which does not include the original photo’s EXIF or GPS metadata. The provider processes images only to fulfill your request; we do not permit use of your photos to train models. We do not store your photos on our servers. Only the structured assessment results (e.g., score, category, brief description) may be saved locally on your device.

## Third‑Party Services

For AI analysis, PawTrack uses reputable cloud providers. These providers process your photos solely to provide the requested result, subject to their terms and applicable data protection safeguards. We do not sell your data and do not share personal information with third parties for advertising.

## Notifications

If you enable reminders, PawTrack uses Apple’s notification system to schedule local notifications on your device. Your reminder details are not transmitted to our servers for delivery.

## Security

We use platform security features and reasonable safeguards to protect your data in transit and at rest. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Your Choices

You can: (1) decline camera/photo permissions; (2) delete or edit pets and events; (3) uninstall the app to remove locally stored data; and (4) decline to use AI BCS.

## Policy Changes

We may update this policy to reflect product or legal changes. Material updates will be reflected in the app. Your continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.

## Contact

For privacy inquiries, please contact the developer via the App Store support channel.
