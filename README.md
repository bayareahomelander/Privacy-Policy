# Privacy Policy (Last Updated: November 21, 2025)

## Overview
Savr (\"we,\" \"our,\" or \"us\") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use the Savr mobile application.

## Data Collection and Storage
Savr is designed as a local-first application. We do not collect, transmit, or store your personal data on external servers. All inventory items, categories, locations, and photos are stored locally on your device. If you choose to use system-level backup features (such as iCloud Backup), your data may be backed up to Apple's servers in accordance with your device settings and Apple's privacy policy.

## Photos and Camera Usage
The app requires access to your device's camera and photo library to allow you to attach images to your inventory items. These images are stored strictly within the app's local storage and are not shared with any third parties.

## Notifications
Savr uses local notifications to remind you of expiring items. These notifications are scheduled and managed entirely on your device. No notification data is transmitted to our servers.
